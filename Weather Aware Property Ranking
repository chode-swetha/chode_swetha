🏡 Weather-Aware Property Ranking & EDA 📊
A powerful and insightful data analysis project that explores Indian real estate trends—combining property features with weather conditions and disaster awareness to develop a custom property scoring system.

🔍 Overview
This project performs an end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on real estate data, enriched with environmental factors like temperature, humidity, and disaster zones. 
The goal is to identify ideal properties using smart analytics and visualizations.

Key Features
✅ Data Cleaning & Validation
✅ Handling Missing Values
✅ Normalization of Key Columns
✅ Univariate, Bivariate, Multivariate Analysis
✅ Custom Property Score Generation
✅ Interactive Visualizations with Plotly
✅ Ranking Based on Environmental & Real Estate Factors

📊 Visual Insights
📈 Trend of Property Prices Over the Years
🏠 Price vs Area with BHK & Location Insights
📌 Top Districts & States by Property Listings
🌡️ Impact of Temperature & Humidity on Housing
⚠️ Pie Chart on Disaster-prone Properties
📦 Boxplots: Price Distribution by State & Year

Scoring Logic
A Custom_Score is assigned to each property by blending:
Price (normalized)
Total Area
Temperature & Weather
Disaster Risk
This helps users identify the most livable and valuable properties at a glance.
